# AudioFromVideoTelegramBot
This bot can help you get audio from any video on YouTube. Just send it a URL.
To use it you should get a token of your bot with help of BotFather
Then you need to create "config_file.py" and write into it your token in a var called "token"
That's all! Now just compile main.py and send "/start" to your bot!
